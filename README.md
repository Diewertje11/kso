# KSO Object Detection models

This is a custom implementation of YOLOv5 by Ultralytics for use with Koster pipelines and data management services. 

## Description

The repository contains both model-specific files (same structure as Ultralytics) as well as specific source files related to Koster pipelines (src folder) and utils (tutorial_utils). The model
will be periodically updated as necessary.
